# Data Science and ML Projects
This repo includes the projects and case studies I have attempted for the purpose of learning through implementation. Main tool used for the analysis is **Jupyter Notebook**. Although all the individual notebooks are inclusive of respective elaboration as appropriate. Anyone learning to grasp the basic concepts of Data Science and ML are highly encouraged to use my notebooks for their understanding on the workings of the techniques or the workflow. 
The pipeline all of my projects have in common:
  - Exploring the dataset, developing a feel of the dataset
  - Explanatory Date Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Modeling
  - Model Optimisation and evaluation
  - Feedback and re-evaluate
  
Some of the projects contain the link for the dataset inside the notebook itself. Still, anyone can reachout to me for the raw dataset or in-case any problem appears in any of my workings, even though google will solve 99.99% of the issues for you. These projects will be in a constantly developing scenario as I will keep updating either the code to give a better output or maybe the workflow a little bit to make it more third-party friendly or maybe automating it, etc. Any sort of feedback and constructive criticism are highly appreciated, as I am comparatively new to version control kindly bare with me if there would be any technical fault from my part. 

I am open to working on any type of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** projects as exploring new challenges is exciting to me and would be happy to help in any of the projects the best I can.
